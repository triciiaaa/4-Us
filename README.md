## Problem Statement
How could we design TikTok Shop such as users are able to share their favourite products found in their For You Page to their friends seamlessly, while remaining engaged in TikTok. 

## Usage
We recommend for TikTok to introduce a new feature called "For Us Page". This feature will allow users to create a collaborative space in which they can enagege with and share TikTok videos and TikTok Shop products to members in the community.<br>

### Creating a Collaborative Folder
The "For Us Page" will allow users to access and create collaborative folders in which they can invite other TikTok users to contribute to this shared space. This folder will act as a shared space for all group members to interact and engage with one another on TikTok.<br>

### Adding TikToks to a Collaborative Folder
Utilizing TikTok's preexisting feature of reposting TikTok videos onto one's profile, users can repost TikToks to the folder, sharing the specific TikTok to all other members in the collaborative space. This feature will allow users to share relevant TikToks to their friends, and these TikToks will be saved to the folder for all members' to view whenever they wish.<br>

### Wishlisting Products
If users found a product they wish to purchase on TikTok shop, they may wishlist the item either to their private wishlist or to their public wishlist. Public wishlists may be viewed by anyone who shares a collaborative folder with the user.

### Faciliating Gift Exchanges
A unique feature of the For Us Page is the ability to faciliate gift giving between members of a collaborative group. Any user is able to access the profile page of any member in a collaborative folder. The profile page shows the user's public wishlist, with links to their desired products on the TikTok Shop.<br>

Additionally, any member in the group is able to initate a gift exchange amongst the members. This will prompt TikTok to randomly match each member to one another in a gift giver-receiver pairing. Through this feature, it will allow members to seamlessly connect with one another and the above mentioned features to improve engagement and interactivity within TikTok Shop.
